  good: `"Many young people today spend a lot of time using smartphones. They use them to talk to friends, play games, and look at pictures. But some people worry that smartphones are not good for children.

First, using smartphones too much can make people tired. When you look at a small screen for a long time, your eyes get tired. Also, many young people stay up late because they are using their phones. This makes them feel sleepy during the day.

Second, spending too much time on smartphones means less time for other important things. Children need to play outside, do homework, and talk to their family. If they use smartphones all day, they don't have time for these activities.

However, smartphones can also be useful. We can use them to learn new things and keep in touch with friends who live far away. The important thing is to use smartphones in a good way, not too much."`,

  bad: `"Contemporary adolescents demonstrate substantial engagement with mobile technology. They utilize these devices to facilitate social interaction, participate in recreational activities, and access visual content. Nevertheless, numerous stakeholders express concern regarding the implications of smartphone usage among minors.

Primarily, excessive screen time contributes to physiological fatigue. Prolonged exposure to diminutive displays induces ocular strain. Furthermore, adolescents frequently maintain irregular sleep patterns due to nocturnal device usage, subsequently experiencing daytime somnolence.

Additionally, disproportionate smartphone engagement diminishes opportunities for alternative essential activities. Children require physical outdoor recreation, academic responsibilities, and familial communication. Comprehensive device utilization precludes adequate time allocation for these pursuits."`,

## 🎯 QUESTION FORMAT: A/B Dialogue (Eiken Exam Standard)

**CRITICAL**: Use dialogue format to eliminate ambiguous answers!

Format structure (MUST use line break after A:):
A: [Context/situation statement]
B: [Response with blank _____]

**CRITICAL**: In your JSON output, use actual newline character \\n between A: and B: lines!

**Why dialogue format?**
- Provides natural context automatically
- Eliminates multiple correct answers
- Matches actual Eiken exam format
- Makes grammar point unambiguous

**GOOD Example** (Clear, unambiguous - note the line break!):
A: Look! Ms. Green is over there.
B: Oh, _____ you say hello to her?

In JSON: "question_text": "A: Look! Ms. Green is over there.\\nB: Oh, _____ you say hello to her?"

Choices: Can, Do, Is, Are
✓ Answer: Can (ability question - context makes this clear)
✗ "Do" would be unnatural in this context ("Oh, do you..." sounds wrong)

**BAD Example** (Ambiguous - DO NOT CREATE):
_____ you say hello to her?

Choices: Can, Do, Is, Are
Problem: Both "Can" (ability) and "Do" (habit) are grammatically correct!
This creates confusion and multiple valid answers.

**Rules for creating dialogue**:
1. Speaker A provides situation/context
2. Speaker B's response contains the blank
3. Context must make only ONE answer natural
4. Test grammar naturally through conversation
5. Both speakers use appropriate ${blueprint.grade} level language

**Context examples for different grammar**:
- Can (ability): "Look! Ms. Green..." → Natural ability question
- Will (future): "Tomorrow is Sunday..." → Natural future plan
- Present continuous: "Where is Tom?" → Natural "He is playing..."
- Past simple: "What did you do yesterday?" → Natural past response
`
    : `
## 🎯 QUESTION FORMAT: Standard Sentence with Context

**IMPORTANT**: Add context to eliminate ambiguous answers!

If a question could have multiple correct answers:
- Add a context sentence BEFORE the question
- Make sure context clarifies which grammar is tested
- Ensure only ONE answer is both grammatically AND contextually correct

Example:
Context: "Tom is learning to swim but he's still a beginner."
Question: He _____ swim 50 meters yet.
Answer: can't (context makes negative ability clear)

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Prevent Multiple Correct Answers

**Your question MUST have EXACTLY ONE correct answer!**

Common mistakes to avoid:
❌ "_____ you like pizza?" (Both "Do" and "Would" work)
❌ "She _____ to school." (Both "goes" and "went" could work)
❌ "I _____ play soccer every weekend." (Both "usually" and nothing work)

Solutions:
✓ Use dialogue format (recommended for ${blueprint.grade})
✓ Add time markers: "yesterday", "every day", "tomorrow"
✓ Add context that specifies the grammar
✓ Make sure distractors are clearly wrong in THIS context

## IMPORTANT: explanation field MUST be in JAPANESE using APPROPRIATE GRADE-LEVEL TERMS

${getExplanationTerminologyGuide(blueprint.grade)}

## 🏫 CRITICAL: Use 4-Block Teacher-Style Explanation Format

Your explanation MUST follow this structure:

**＜着眼点＞**
Point out key hints in the question (keywords, time markers, context clues)
Example: "if（もし〜なら）と tomorrow（明日）があるので、『未来の条件』の文です。"

**＜${blueprint.grade === '5' || blueprint.grade === '4' ? 'Point！' : '鉄則！'}＞**
State the grammar rule clearly and concisely (1-2 sentences)
Example: "時・条件の副詞節（if / when など）では、未来のことでも現在形を使います。"

**＜当てはめ＞**
Apply the rule to this specific question
Example: "if の中は現在形にするので、主語が it（3単現）なので、rains になります。"

**＜誤答の理由＞**
Explain why each wrong choice is incorrect (one line per choice, end with ×)
Example: "rain：動詞の原形。3単現のsがついていないので ×"

**CRITICAL**: 
- Use age-appropriate terminology as specified in the guide above!
- DO NOT use vague phrases like "未来を表す文なので will を使います" without explaining the rule
- DO specify grammar forms: 動詞の原形、過去形、現在進行形、3単現のs, etc.

## Important Notes
- ONE blank per sentence only
- ${useDialogFormat ? '**CRITICAL**: Use A/B dialogue format with actual line break (\\n) between speakers! Example: "A: text\\nB: text"' : 'Provide clear context clues'}
- Distractors should be plausible but clearly wrong IN THIS CONTEXT
- Use natural, authentic English
- The sentence must relate to the topic: ${topic.topic_label_en}
- **MUST provide**:
  1. Japanese translation of the ENTIRE question (translation_ja)
  2. Japanese meanings for ALL vocabulary choices (correct answer + all distractors)
  3. Japanese meanings for KEY PHRASES and IDIOMS in the question text (e.g., "keep in touch with" = 「〜と連絡を取り合う」)
- **CRITICAL**: Ensure ONLY ONE answer is correct - no ambiguity allowed!
${useDialogFormat ? '- **LINE BREAK REQUIREMENT**: Your question_text MUST contain \\n character: "A: ... \\nB: ..."' : ''}

## 🌐 Translation & Vocabulary Requirements
**CRITICAL**: Students need to understand the question to answer it!
- translation_ja: Provide COMPLETE Japanese translation of question_text
  ${useDialogFormat ? '- If dialogue format, translate BOTH A: and B: lines' : ''}
- vocabulary_meanings: Include ALL important words/phrases:
  * All answer choices (correct + distractors)
  * Key phrases/idioms in question (e.g., "keep in touch with", "used to", "look forward to")
  * Any difficult vocabulary that ${blueprint.grade} students might not know`;

## 🎯 CRITICAL VOCABULARY REQUIREMENTS (PRIMARY GOAL FOR LONG PASSAGES)

**TARGET LEVEL**: ${guidelines.vocabulary_level} ONLY
**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: 90%+ of words must be within ${guidelines.vocabulary_level}
**FAILURE CONSEQUENCE**: If too many difficult words, passage will be REJECTED (aim for 85%+ minimum)

**⚠️ Phase 3 WARNING**: Previous attempts scored 76.3% - this is TOO LOW and will be REJECTED.
You MUST use simpler vocabulary throughout the entire passage. Every sentence matters!

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN WORDS (NEVER USE IN 200-300 WORD PASSAGES)

**Phase 3 Update**: Expanded forbidden words list for better vocabulary control

**Academic Verbs (NEVER)**: 
- facilitate, demonstrate, implement, establish, utilize, constitute, articulate
- examine, analyze, evaluate, assess, investigate, emphasize, acknowledge
- manifest, exemplify, elucidate, ascertain, discern, endeavor

**Abstract Adjectives (NEVER)**: 
- sophisticated, comprehensive, substantial, considerable, prominent, profound, intricate
- significant, essential, crucial, fundamental, inevitable, remarkable
- substantial, predominant, comprehensive, considerable

**Formal Connectors (NEVER)**: 
- furthermore, moreover, nevertheless, consequently, hence, whereas, thereby, notwithstanding
- accordingly, thus, henceforth, thereafter, whereby

**C1/C2 Words (NEVER)**: 
- contemporary, predominantly, subsequently, ambiguous, endeavor, implications, stakeholders
- adolescent (use "young people"), numerous (use "many"), acquire (use "get/learn")
- proficiency (use "skill"), multilingual (use "speak many languages")
- diminutive (use "small"), physiological (use "body"), ocular (use "eye")
- disproportionate (use "too much"), precludes (use "stops/prevents")

**Common Traps to Avoid**:
- Don't use: "individuals" → Use: "people"
- Don't use: "purchase" → Use: "buy"
- Don't use: "commence" → Use: "start/begin"
- Don't use: "terminate" → Use: "end/stop"
- Don't use: "assist" → Use: "help"
- Don't use: "obtain" → Use: "get"
- Don't use: "require" → Use: "need"
- Don't use: "sufficient" → Use: "enough"

## ✅ GOOD EXAMPLE (92% vocabulary score - THIS IS YOUR TARGET QUALITY)

${LONG_READING_FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES.good}

**Why this works**:
${LONG_READING_FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES.good_analysis}

## ❌ BAD EXAMPLE (69% vocabulary score - THIS WILL BE REJECTED - DO NOT IMITATE)

${LONG_READING_FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES.bad}

**Problems identified**:
${LONG_READING_FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES.bad_problems.map(p => `- ${p}`).join('\n')}

## 📝 WRITING STRATEGY FOR LONG PASSAGES (Phase 3 Enhanced)

**CRITICAL**: Every word counts in a 200-300 word passage. One difficult word can drop your score by 0.3-0.5%.

1. **Use short sentences** (10-15 words maximum for long passages)
   - Bad: "Contemporary adolescents demonstrate substantial engagement with mobile technology."
   - Good: "Many young people today spend a lot of time using smartphones."

2. **Repeat key words**: Don't avoid repetition - clarity is MORE important than variety
   - It's OK to repeat "people", "important", "use" multiple times
   - NEVER replace simple words with complex synonyms

3. **Choose simple words FIRST** (A1-A2 level):
   - Daily verbs: go, come, use, make, help, want, need, like, know, think, feel, see, hear
   - Common nouns: people, time, day, way, thing, place, home, work, school, friend, family
   - Basic adjectives: good, bad, new, old, big, small, important, difficult, easy, happy, sad

4. **Break paragraphs clearly**: One main idea per paragraph (4-5 sentences each)

5. **Simple transitions ONLY**: First, Second, Also, But, However, So, Then
   - NEVER: Nevertheless, Furthermore, Moreover, Consequently, Thus

6. **Self-check after EVERY sentence**: "Would a ${blueprint.grade} student know ALL these words?"
   - If you have ANY doubt, use a simpler word!

## 📖 VOCABULARY NOTES REQUIREMENT (Phase 4A Enhanced)

**CRITICAL**: Vocabulary notes allow you to use richer vocabulary while maintaining accessibility!

**Strategy**: You can now use up to 5-8 slightly higher-level words (B2) IF you provide notes
- This makes your passage more natural and authentic
- Students learn these words in context (highest learning effectiveness)
- Matches real Eiken exam format (語注付き)

**Guidelines**:
1. **Use mostly A2-B1 vocabulary** (80-85% of words)
2. **Add 5-8 B2 words WITH notes** (allows richer expression)
3. **Focus on content words**: important nouns, key verbs, essential adjectives
4. **Provide clear Japanese definitions**

**Example - Good vocabulary selection with notes**:
Passage: "Many young people today are concerned about climate change. They worry about the environment..."

Vocabulary Notes:
• "concerned" (B2) → 心配している、関心がある
• "climate change" (B2) → 気候変動
• "environment" (B2) → 環境

**DON'T select**:
❌ Function words (the, is, and, but)
❌ Words students already know (go, come, big, small)
❌ Words that are TOO difficult even with notes (C1/C2 words)

**Format**:
• "word/phrase" → 日本語での定義

## 📖 VOCABULARY NOTES REQUIREMENT

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST provide vocabulary notes for 5-8 key terms from your passage.
- Select words that are important for understanding the passage
- Choose words that appear in the passage and might be slightly challenging
- Provide clear, simple Japanese definitions
- Focus on content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) rather than grammar words

**Example vocabulary notes format**:
• "smartphone" → スマートフォン、携帯電話
• "worried" → 心配している
• "outdoor" → 屋外の、外の

## 🎯 YOUR TASK

Topic: "${topic.topic_label_en}" (${topic.topic_label_ja})

## Topic Context
${topic.scenario_description}

## Requirements

## Passage Specifications
- Length: 200-300 words (for ${blueprint.grade} level)
- CEFR Level: ${guidelines.vocabulary_level}
- Complexity: ${guidelines.complexity}
- Number of questions: 3-4
- Structure: Clear intro, 2-3 body paragraphs, simple conclusion

## ✓ FINAL SELF-CHECK (Phase 3 Enhanced - MANDATORY before responding)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Your passage MUST score 85%+ or it will be REJECTED. Check EVERY word!

□ Are 90%+ of my words at ${guidelines.vocabulary_level} level? (Target: 85% minimum)
□ Did I avoid ALL forbidden words listed above? (Zero tolerance)
□ Did I use short, clear sentences (10-15 words)? (Every sentence counts)
□ Is each paragraph focused on one main idea? (4-5 sentences each)
□ Did I follow the GOOD example style (92%), not the BAD example (69%)?
□ Did I check EVERY adjective, verb, and noun for complexity?
□ Did I avoid ALL academic/formal vocabulary?
□ Would a ${blueprint.grade} student understand EVERY word without a dictionary?

**IF YOU ANSWERED "NO" OR "MAYBE" TO ANY QUESTION ABOVE, REWRITE THE PASSAGE!**

}

## Important Notes (Phase 3 Critical Requirements)

- Passage should have clear structure (intro, body, conclusion)
- Questions test different skills (main idea, details, inference)
- All information needed to answer must be in the passage
- Topic: ${topic.topic_label_en}
- **CRITICAL**: explanation field MUST be in JAPANESE (日本語) using APPROPRIATE GRADE-LEVEL TERMS
- For each question, explanation MUST cover why the correct answer is right AND why each wrong choice is incorrect
- **MUST include 5-8 vocabulary notes** for key terms that appear in the passage

${getExplanationTerminologyGuide(blueprint.grade)}

**IMPORTANT for explanations**:
- Use age-appropriate language as specified in the guide above
- Avoid overly complex grammatical terminology
- Focus on "what it means" and "when to use it" rather than abstract definitions

## 🚨 FINAL WARNING (Phase 3)

**Previous attempts scored 76.3% - THIS IS TOO LOW!**

Your passage will be AUTOMATICALLY REJECTED if:
- Vocabulary score is below 85%
- You use ANY word from the forbidden list
- You use academic/formal language
- Sentences are too long (>15 words)

**SUCCESS FORMULA**:
- Simple words (A1-A2) + Short sentences (10-15 words) + Clear structure = PASS
- Complex words + Long sentences + Formal tone = FAIL

**REMEMBER**: Writing simply for 200-300 words is HARD but ESSENTIAL. Complex vocabulary = REJECTED passage!`;

**IMPORTANT for guidance and explanations**:

- Avoid overly technical grammatical terminology in outline_guidance
- Focus on "what to write" and "how to structure" rather than abstract writing theory`;
